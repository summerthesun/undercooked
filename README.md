15-112 Term Project

Hello! 

Welcome to UNDERCOOKED, my CMU 15-112 term project game based on Ghost Town Game's 'Overcooked'. This is a single-player game that has a top-down view of a kitchen equipped with cutting boards, grills, food bins, condiment bottles, a serving area, and regular kitchen counters. The objective of the game is to complete 5 orders in 4 minutes while getting the highest score possible. 

This project should run in a source-code editor like VSCode. Once all images and the cmu_112_graphics.py file are added, run the file titled UNDERCOOKED.py to start the game. 

No libraries need to be installed to run this game. 

Please note! This is a randomly generating maze that on slim occasions will trap the user within a portion of the screen. When starting the game, first check that the map is usable before playing and that all food source bins are present, otherwise run the code again. 

Not-so-secret Shortcuts:

Press 's' to restart the timer.
Press 'p' to pause the game.
Press 'f' to generate a bun at a random position on the screen.
Press 'g' to generate a wiener at a random position on the screen.

Thank you for reading! Have fun.
